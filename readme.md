Hi, I'm Gabriel Monteiro, a Brazilian student who loves technologies!
My dream is to be a great programmer and work/collaborate on big companies.
Actually I'm learning Python and developing my first game. I want to learn JavaScript soon, too.
If you want to talk to me, send an e-mail to gabrielmonteirodassalles@hotmail.com. I'll be waiting for you there!
